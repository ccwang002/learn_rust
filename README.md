## Learning Rust

Here lies my reading notes and practicing source codes during my rust learning. I learn Rust from the following sources:


- Jim Blandy and Jason Orendorff (early access). [*Programming Rust*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040385.do). O'Reilly Media.
- Ralf Jung. [*Rust-101*](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/)
